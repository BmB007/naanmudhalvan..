# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on credit card fraud detection using a Logistic Regression model. It aims to identify fraudulent transactions within a credit card dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains credit card transaction data. You can find the dataset [here](link_to_dataset). It includes information such as the transaction amount, time, and the target variable 'Class' (0 for legitimate transactions, 1 for fraudulent transactions).

## Project Overview

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded, explored, and preprocessed to handle class imbalance.

- Data Analysis: The legitimate and fraudulent transactions are analyzed separately.

- Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is used to predict fraud detection.

- Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated on training and test data.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```

3. Run the Python script:

```
python credit_card_fraud_detection.py
```

## Results

The accuracy of the Logistic Regression model on training and test data is reported.

- Training Data Accuracy: XX%
- Test Data Accuracy: YY%
